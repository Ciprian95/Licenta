## Cloud training tasks

### -> research and find out how to make a dataset suitable for Google ML Engine (maybe H5)
### -> run training on Google Cloud ML Engine
### -> run distributed training on Google Compute Engine
### ...

## Local training tasks

### -> fix ResNet50 local training (at the moment a full model epoch training is inserted at the beginning)
### -> train local models on CPU and note duration per epoch
### -> compare local CPU vs GPU (duration, convergence time)
### ...
